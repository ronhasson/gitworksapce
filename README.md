# Git Workspace MCP Extension

A comprehensive Desktop Extension (DXT) that provides AI assistants with intelligent, secure access to Git repositories. This extension combines the robustness of the official filesystem MCP server with advanced Git integration and workflow intelligence.

**Enhanced with advanced corruption protection, memory-efficient operations, and intelligent line-by-line matching.**

## üéØ **Key Features**

### **üîí Security First**
- **Atomic File Operations**: All file writes use temporary files and atomic renames to prevent corruption
- **Path Validation**: Comprehensive security validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- **Symlink Protection**: Handles symlinks safely, preventing access outside the workspace
- **Read-Only Git**: All Git operations are read-only - human developers maintain full control

### **üß† Intelligent Workflow Guidance**
- **Prevents Line Number Guessing**: Tool descriptions guide LLMs to read files before editing
- **Corruption Protection**: Automatic backup and verification for all file operations  
- **Workflow Enforcement**: Built-in best practices prevent common AI coding mistakes
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with actionable recovery suggestions

### **‚ö° Performance Optimized**
- **Lightning-Fast File Indexing**: Parallel processing with smart directory filtering
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles projects from 100 files to 100,000+ files efficiently
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized for both older laptops and modern workstations
- **Smart Directory Skipping**: Automatically filters out build/dependency directories

### **üî¨ Advanced Features** 
- **Memory-Efficient File Operations**: Tail/head support for large files without loading entire content
- **Intelligent Line Matching**: Line-by-line matching with flexible whitespace handling
- **Indentation Preservation**: Maintains code formatting during find/replace operations

## üì¶ **Installation**

### **For Claude Desktop Users**
1. Download the `.dxt` file
2. Double-click to open with Claude Desktop
3. Follow the configuration prompts
4. Select your Git repository directory
5. The extension will be immediately available

### **For Other MCP Clients**
1. Extract the `.dxt` file (it's a ZIP archive)
2. Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure your MCP client to use the server:

```json
{
  "git-workspace": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["path/to/server/index.js"],
    "env": {
      "WORKSPACE_PATH": "/path/to/your/git/repository"
    }
  }
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Options**

When installing through Claude Desktop, you'll be prompted to configure:

- **Git Workspace Directory**: The root directory of your Git repository (required)
- **Enable Fast File Indexing**: Build an index for faster searching (recommended)
- **Maximum File Size**: Skip files larger than this to prevent performance issues (default: 10MB)
- **Debug Mode**: Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting (default: off)

## üöÄ **Usage Examples**

### **Intelligent File Editing Workflow**

The extension enforces safe editing practices:

```
Human: "Update the API endpoint in config.js"

AI: I'll help you update the API endpoint. Let me first read the current config to see what needs to be changed.

[Uses read_file to see current content]
[Uses preview_edit to show what will change]
[Uses edit_file to apply the changes]  
[Uses read_file to verify the results]
```

### **Git Integration**

Check repository status and review changes:

```
Human: "What changes have I made to the authentication system?"

AI: Let me check your Git status and examine the authentication-related changes.

[Uses git_status to see modified files]
[Uses git_diff to show specific changes]
[Uses find_files to locate auth-related files]
```

### **Project Exploration**

Quickly understand and navigate large codebases:

```
Human: "Show me the structure of this project and find all the database-related files"

AI: I'll give you an overview of the project structure and locate database files.

[Uses get_project_structure for overview]
[Uses search_content to find database references]
[Uses find_files with pattern matching]
```

## üîß **Technical Architecture**

### **Security Model**
- All file operations are restricted to the configured workspace directory
- Path validation prevents directory traversal (../ attacks)
- Symlinks are resolved and validated to ensure they stay within workspace
- Git operations are explicitly read-only - no commits, pushes, or destructive operations

### **Performance Optimization**
- File index builds in parallel using worker processes
- Smart directory filtering skips `node_modules`, `.git`, `build`, etc.
- Memory-efficient streaming for large files
- Configurable file size limits prevent system overload

### **Intelligent Workflow**
- Tool descriptions guide LLMs toward safe practices
- Error messages include recovery instructions
- Built-in verification steps prevent file corruption
- Workflow enforcement prevents common AI coding mistakes

## üìä **Performance Benchmarks**

Typical indexing performance on various project sizes:

- **Small projects** (<1,000 files): ~0.5 seconds
- **Medium projects** (~5,000 files): ~2-4 seconds  
- **Large projects** (~50,000 files): ~8-15 seconds
- **Projects with node_modules**: Filtered out immediately during scan

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**"Access denied" errors**:
- Ensure the workspace path is correctly configured
- Check that the directory exists and is readable
- Verify you're not trying to access files outside the workspace

**Slow performance**:
- Enable file indexing for faster searches
- Increase the maximum file size limit if needed
- Consider excluding large binary files from your workspace

**Git operations failing**:
- Ensure Git is installed and accessible in PATH
- Verify you're in a Git repository
- Check that the workspace directory contains a `.git` folder

### **Debug Mode**

Enable debug mode during configuration to see detailed logging:

```
ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE=true
```

This will show detailed information about file operations, Git commands, and performance metrics.
